# Algorithm Visualizer

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React.

There are 6 segments

-   Pathfinder
-   Prime Numbers
-   Sorting Algorithms
-   N Queen
-   Binary Search Game
-   Recursion Tree

I have implemented a total of `24 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.

## Algorithms implemented

-   Graph Search
    -   DFS
    -   BFS
    -   Dijkstra
    -   A star
    -   Recursive Maze Creation
-   Sorting
    -   Bubble sort
    -   Selection sort
    -   Insertion sort
    -   Heap sort
    -   Merge sort
    -   Quick sort
-   Sieve of Eratosthenes
-   Archimedes Spiral
-   N Queen Backtracking
-   Binary Search
-   Recursion
    -   Fibonacci Number
    -   Binomial Coefficient
    -   Derangement
    -   Fast Exponentiation
    -   Stirling Number of Second Kind

### Acknowledgement

I took inspirations from the following sources for some of the segments.

-   `Pathfinder`: [The Projects That Got Me Into Google](https://youtu.be/n4t_-NjY_Sg)
-   `Recursion tree visualizer`: [Recursion Tree Visualizer](https://github.com/brpapa/recursion-tree-visualizer)

### Run locally

Make sure you have node installed in your system. Then run

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

This will start the app in `http://localhost:3000/AlgorithmVisualizer#/`
